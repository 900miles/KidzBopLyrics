Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"

Five days since you laughed at me <span class="diff_sub">&nbsp;</span>

Saying,
<br>
"Get that together, come back and see me"

<br>
Three days since the living room
<br>
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you

Yesterday, you'd forgiven me

But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink <span class="diff_sub">&nbsp;</span>

I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan

Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know <span class="diff_sub">&nbsp;</span>
<br>
<span class="diff_sub">The</span> vertigo is gonna grow

'Cause it's so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver
<br>

<br>
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
<br>
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
<br>
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
<br>
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
<br>
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
<br>
I have a history of taking off my shirt
<br>

<br>
It's been one week since you looked at me
<br>
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
<br>
Five days since you tackled me
<br>
I
<br>
still got the rug burns on both my knees

<br>
It's been three days since the afternoon

You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon
